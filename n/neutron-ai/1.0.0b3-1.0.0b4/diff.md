 ## Why Neutron?
 
 The purpose of Neutron is straightforward: to provide security professionals  with access to a free AI assistant that can be invoked directly from their command line interface. It was built as part of the free tier of [Nebula Pro](https://www.berylliumsec.com/nebula-pro-waitlist).

 ## Compatibility
 
 Neutron has been extensively tested and optimized for Linux platforms. As of now, its functionality on Windows or macOS is not guaranteed, and it may not operate as expected.
 
 ## System dependencies
 
 - Storage: A minimum of 50GB is recommended.
 
-- RAM: A minimum of 16GB RAM memory is recommended.
+- RAM: A minimum of 32GB RAM memory is recommended.
 
 - Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) (NOT MANDATORY, Neutron can run on CPU): While not mandatory, having at least 24GB of GPU memory is recommended for optimal performance.
 
 
 **PYPI based distribution requirement(s)**
 
 - Python3: Version 3.10 or later is required for compatibility with all used libraries.

 After adding, restart your terminal or run 'source ~/.bashrc' (or 'source ~/.zshrc') to apply the changes.
