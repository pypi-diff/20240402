 ## Installation **Prerequisites** - [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/
 anaconda/install/) Create a new environment and install the required
 dependencies to clone AutoViz: **From PyPi:** ```sh cd git clone
 git@github.com:AutoViML/AutoViz.git # or download and unzip https://github.com/
 AutoViML/AutoViz/archive/master.zip conda create -n python=3.7 anaconda conda
-activate # ON WINDOWS: `source activate ` cd AutoViz pip install -
-r requirements.txt ``` ## Usage Discover how to use AutoViz in this Medium
-article. In the AutoViz directory, open a Jupyter Notebook or open a command
-palette (terminal) and use the following code to instantiate the AutoViz_Class.
-You can simply run this code step by step: ```python from autoviz import
-AutoViz_Class AV = AutoViz_Class() dft = AV.AutoViz(filename) ``` AutoViz can
-use any input either filename (in CSV, txt, or JSON format) or a pandas
-dataframe. If you have a large dataset, you can set the `max_rows_analyzed` and
-`max_cols_analyzed` arguments to speed up the visualization by asking autoviz
-to sample your dataset. AutoViz can also create charts in multiple formats
-using the `chart_format` setting: - If `chart_format ='png'` or `'svg'` or
-`'jpg'`: Matplotlib charts are plotted inline. * Can be saved locally (using
-`verbose=2` setting) or displayed (`verbose=1`) in Jupyter Notebooks. * This is
-the default behavior for AutoViz. - If `chart_format='bokeh'`: Interactive
-Bokeh charts are plotted in Jupyter Notebooks. - If `chart_format='server'`,
-dashboards will pop up for each kind of chart on your browser. - If
-`chart_format='html'`, interactive Bokeh charts will be created and silently
-saved as HTML files under the `AutoViz_Plots` directory (under working folder)
-or any other directory that you specify using the `save_plot_dir` setting
-(during input). ## API Arguments for `AV.AutoViz()` method: - `filename`: Use
-an empty string ("") if there's no associated filename and you want to use a
-dataframe. In that case, using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise
-provide a filename and leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of
-them can be used. - `sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any
-column-separating value) if you use a filename above. - `depVar`: Target
-variable in your dataset; set it as an empty string if not applicable. -
-`dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe for plotting charts; leave it as empty
-string if using a filename. - `header`: set the row number of the header row in
-your file (0 for the first row). Otherwise leave it as 0. - `verbose`: 0 for
-minimal info and charts, 1 for more info and charts, or 2 for saving charts
-locally without display. - `lowess`: Use regression lines for each pair of
-continuous variables against the target variable in small datasets; avoid using
-for large datasets (>100,000 rows). - `chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg',
-'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for displaying or saving charts in various
-formats, depending on the verbose option. - `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max
-number of rows to use for visualization when dealing with very large datasets
-(millions of rows). A statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz.
-Default is 150000 rows. - `max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous

+ensure that AutoViz works seamlessly with your Python environment by installing
+compatible versions of libraries like HoloViews, Bokeh, and hvPlot. Please
+select the requirement file that corresponds to your Python version to enjoy a
+smooth experience with AutoViz.
+## Usage Discover how to use AutoViz in this Medium article. In the AutoViz
+directory, open a Jupyter Notebook or open a command palette (terminal) and use
+the following code to instantiate the AutoViz_Class. You can simply run this
+code step by step: ```python from autoviz import AutoViz_Class AV =
+AutoViz_Class() dft = AV.AutoViz(filename) ``` AutoViz can use any input either
+filename (in CSV, txt, or JSON format) or a pandas dataframe. If you have a
+large dataset, you can set the `max_rows_analyzed` and `max_cols_analyzed`
+arguments to speed up the visualization by asking autoviz to sample your
+dataset. AutoViz can also create charts in multiple formats using the
+`chart_format` setting: - If `chart_format ='png'` or `'svg'` or `'jpg'`:
+Matplotlib charts are plotted inline. * Can be saved locally (using `verbose=2`
+setting) or displayed (`verbose=1`) in Jupyter Notebooks. * This is the default
+behavior for AutoViz. - If `chart_format='bokeh'`: Interactive Bokeh charts are
+plotted in Jupyter Notebooks. - If `chart_format='server'`, dashboards will pop
+up for each kind of chart on your browser. - If `chart_format='html'`,
+interactive Bokeh charts will be created and silently saved as HTML files under
+the `AutoViz_Plots` directory (under working folder) or any other directory
+that you specify using the `save_plot_dir` setting (during input). ## API
+Arguments for `AV.AutoViz()` method: - `filename`: Use an empty string ("") if
+there's no associated filename and you want to use a dataframe. In that case,
+using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise provide a filename and
+leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of them can be used. -
+`sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any column-separating value)
+if you use a filename above. - `depVar`: Target variable in your dataset; set
+it as an empty string if not applicable. - `dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe
+for plotting charts; leave it as empty string if using a filename. - `header`:
+set the row number of the header row in your file (0 for the first row).
+Otherwise leave it as 0. - `verbose`: 0 for minimal info and charts, 1 for more
+info and charts, or 2 for saving charts locally without display. - `lowess`:
+Use regression lines for each pair of continuous variables against the target
+variable in small datasets; avoid using for large datasets (>100,000 rows). -
+`chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg', 'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for
+displaying or saving charts in various formats, depending on the verbose
+option. - `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max number of rows to use for
+visualization when dealing with very large datasets (millions of rows). A
+statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz. Default is 150000 rows. -
+`max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous variables to be analyzed.
+Defaul is 30 columns. - `save_plot_dir`: Directory for saving plots. Default is
+None, which saves plots under the current directory in a subfolder named
+AutoViz_Plots. If the save_plot_dir doesn't exist, it will be created. ##

+there's no associated filename and you want to use a dataframe. In that case,
+using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise provide a filename and
+leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of them can be used. -
+`sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any column-separating value)
+if you use a filename above. - `depVar`: Target variable in your dataset; set
+it as an empty string if not applicable. - `dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe
+for plotting charts; leave it as empty string if using a filename. - `header`:
+set the row number of the header row in your file (0 for the first row).
+Otherwise leave it as 0. - `verbose`: 0 for minimal info and charts, 1 for more
+info and charts, or 2 for saving charts locally without display. - `lowess`:
+Use regression lines for each pair of continuous variables against the target
+variable in small datasets; avoid using for large datasets (>100,000 rows). -
+`chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg', 'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for
+displaying or saving charts in various formats, depending on the verbose
+option. - `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max number of rows to use for
+visualization when dealing with very large datasets (millions of rows). A
+statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz. Default is 150000 rows. -
+`max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous variables to be analyzed.
+Defaul is 30 columns. - `save_plot_dir`: Directory for saving plots. Default is
+None, which saves plots under the current directory in a subfolder named
+AutoViz_Plots. If the save_plot_dir doesn't exist, it will be created. ##
+Examples Here are some examples to help you get started with AutoViz. If you
+need full jupyter notebooks with code samples they can be found in [examples]
+(https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/tree/master/Examples) folder. ### Example
+1: Visualize a CSV file with a target variable ```python from autoviz import
 AutoViz_Class AV = AutoViz_Class() filename = "your_file.csv" target_variable =
-"your_target_variable" custom_plot_dir = "your_custom_plot_directory" dft =
-AV.AutoViz( filename, sep=",", depVar=target_variable, dfte=None, header=0,
-verbose=2, lowess=False, chart_format="bokeh", max_rows_analyzed=150000,
-max_cols_analyzed=30, save_plot_dir=custom_plot_dir ) ``` ![bokeh_charts]
-(images/bokeh_charts.JPG) These examples should give you an idea of how to use
-AutoViz with different scenarios and settings. By tailoring the options and
-settings, you can generate visualizations that best suit your needs, whether
-you're working with large datasets, interactive charts, or simply exploring the
-relationships between variables. ## Maintainers AutoViz is actively maintained
-and improved by a team of dedicated developers. If you have any questions,
-suggestions, or issues, feel free to reach out to the maintainers: -

     * AutoViz will visualize any sized file using a statistically valid sample.
     * COMMA is the default separator in the file, but you can change it.
     * Assumes the first row as the header in the file, but this can be changed.
 - **By leveraging AutoViz's powerful and flexible features**, you can
 streamline your data visualization process and gain valuable insights more
 efficiently. Happy visualizing! ## DISCLAIMER This project is not an official

         ## Latest
         The latest updates about `autoviz` library can be found in <a href="https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/blob/master/updates.md">Updates page</a>.
         
         ## ImportantAnnouncement
-        ### Starting with version 0.1.801, an important Update Regarding Dependency Management
-        We're excited to announce a significant update to AutoViz that enhances compatibility with various Python versions and streamlines dependency management!
-        <li>Modular Dependency Loading: AutoViz now uses a more flexible approach for importing visualization libraries starting with version `0.1.801`. This means you only need to install certain dependencies (like hvplot and holoviews) if you plan to use specific backends (e.g., bokeh). This change significantly reduces installation issues for users on newer Python versions such as 3.10 and higher.</li>
-        
-        <li>Improved Backend Support: Depending on your Python environment, AutoViz dynamically adjusts to use compatible visualization libraries, ensuring a smoother user experience. Requirements:
-                "holoviews>=1.14.9",
-                "bokeh>=2.4.2",
-                "hvplot>=0.7.3",
-                "panel>=0.12.6".
-        </li>
+        ### Starting with version 0.1.807, an important update regarding Python Version Management
+        <li>We're excited to announce we've made significant updates to our `setup.py` script to dynamically manage dependencies based on your Python version. This means that when you install AutoViz, the installation process will automatically select versions of dependencies such as HoloViews, Bokeh, and hvPlot that are best suited to your specific Python environment.
+        
+        For `Python versions below 3.10`, AutoViz will use versions of its dependencies known to be stable and compatible with older Python versions.
+        
+        For `Python 3.10`, the script has been configured to use updated dependencies that address specific fixes and enhancements relevant to this version.
+        
+        For `Python 3.11 and newer versions`, setup.py ensures compatibility by selecting library versions that support the latest Python features and fixes, including critical updates made in HoloViews for Python 3.11 support.</li>
         
         ### What Does This Mean for You?
-        <li>Easier Installation: If you've faced challenges installing AutoViz due to dependency conflicts, this update is for you. Now, you can install AutoViz without needing to install all its visualization dependencies upfront.</li>

-Update Regarding Dependency Management We're excited to announce a significant
-update to AutoViz that enhances compatibility with various Python versions and
-streamlines dependency management!
-Modular Dependency Loading: AutoViz now uses a more flexible approach for
-importing visualization libraries starting with version `0.1.801`. This means
-you only need to install certain dependencies (like hvplot and holoviews) if
-you plan to use specific backends (e.g., bokeh). This change significantly
-reduces installation issues for users on newer Python versions such as 3.10 and
-higher.
-Improved Backend Support: Depending on your Python environment, AutoViz
-dynamically adjusts to use compatible visualization libraries, ensuring a
-smoother user experience. Requirements: "holoviews>=1.14.9", "bokeh>=2.4.2",
-"hvplot>=0.7.3", "panel>=0.12.6".
+_p_a_g_e. ## ImportantAnnouncement ### Starting with version 0.1.807, an important
+update regarding Python Version Management
+We're excited to announce we've made significant updates to our `setup.py`
+script to dynamically manage dependencies based on your Python version. This
+means that when you install AutoViz, the installation process will
+automatically select versions of dependencies such as HoloViews, Bokeh, and
+hvPlot that are best suited to your specific Python environment. For `Python
+versions below 3.10`, AutoViz will use versions of its dependencies known to be
+stable and compatible with older Python versions. For `Python 3.10`, the script
+has been configured to use updated dependencies that address specific fixes and
+enhancements relevant to this version. For `Python 3.11 and newer versions`,
+setup.py ensures compatibility by selecting library versions that support the
+latest Python features and fixes, including critical updates made in HoloViews
+for Python 3.11 support.
 ### What Does This Mean for You?
-Easier Installation: If you've faced challenges installing AutoViz due to
-dependency conflicts, this update is for you. Now, you can install AutoViz
-without needing to install all its visualization dependencies upfront.

 ## Installation **Prerequisites** - [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/
 anaconda/install/) Create a new environment and install the required
 dependencies to clone AutoViz: **From PyPi:** ```sh cd git clone
 git@github.com:AutoViML/AutoViz.git # or download and unzip https://github.com/
 AutoViML/AutoViz/archive/master.zip conda create -n python=3.7 anaconda conda
-activate # ON WINDOWS: `source activate ` cd AutoViz pip install -
-r requirements.txt ``` ## Usage Discover how to use AutoViz in this Medium
-article. In the AutoViz directory, open a Jupyter Notebook or open a command
-palette (terminal) and use the following code to instantiate the AutoViz_Class.
-You can simply run this code step by step: ```python from autoviz import
-AutoViz_Class AV = AutoViz_Class() dft = AV.AutoViz(filename) ``` AutoViz can
-use any input either filename (in CSV, txt, or JSON format) or a pandas
-dataframe. If you have a large dataset, you can set the `max_rows_analyzed` and
-`max_cols_analyzed` arguments to speed up the visualization by asking autoviz
-to sample your dataset. AutoViz can also create charts in multiple formats
-using the `chart_format` setting: - If `chart_format ='png'` or `'svg'` or
-`'jpg'`: Matplotlib charts are plotted inline. * Can be saved locally (using
-`verbose=2` setting) or displayed (`verbose=1`) in Jupyter Notebooks. * This is
-the default behavior for AutoViz. - If `chart_format='bokeh'`: Interactive
-Bokeh charts are plotted in Jupyter Notebooks. - If `chart_format='server'`,
-dashboards will pop up for each kind of chart on your browser. - If
-`chart_format='html'`, interactive Bokeh charts will be created and silently
-saved as HTML files under the `AutoViz_Plots` directory (under working folder)
-or any other directory that you specify using the `save_plot_dir` setting
-(during input). ## API Arguments for `AV.AutoViz()` method: - `filename`: Use
-an empty string ("") if there's no associated filename and you want to use a
-dataframe. In that case, using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise
-provide a filename and leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of
-them can be used. - `sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any
-column-separating value) if you use a filename above. - `depVar`: Target
-variable in your dataset; set it as an empty string if not applicable. -
-`dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe for plotting charts; leave it as empty
-string if using a filename. - `header`: set the row number of the header row in
-your file (0 for the first row). Otherwise leave it as 0. - `verbose`: 0 for
-minimal info and charts, 1 for more info and charts, or 2 for saving charts
-locally without display. - `lowess`: Use regression lines for each pair of
-continuous variables against the target variable in small datasets; avoid using
-for large datasets (>100,000 rows). - `chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg',
-'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for displaying or saving charts in various
-formats, depending on the verbose option. - `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max
-number of rows to use for visualization when dealing with very large datasets
-(millions of rows). A statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz.
-Default is 150000 rows. - `max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous
-variables to be analyzed. Defaul is 30 columns. - `save_plot_dir`: Directory
-for saving plots. Default is None, which saves plots under the current
-directory in a subfolder named AutoViz_Plots. If the save_plot_dir doesn't
-exist, it will be created. ## Examples Here are some examples to help you get
-started with AutoViz. If you need full jupyter notebooks with code samples they
-can be found in [examples](https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/tree/master/
